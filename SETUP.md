# Java Chat Application Project Setup

## Introduction
This document provides the necessary steps to set up your environment for the Java Chat Application project. Follow these instructions to ensure that you have all the required tools and dependencies installed to start developing the application.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Java programming.
- A GitHub account for version control.
- Familiarity with your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Java, such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.

## Step 1: Install Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. We recommend using JDK 11 or later.
- Download the JDK from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or use a package manager like Homebrew (for macOS) or apt (for Ubuntu).

## Step 2: Install an IDE
- If you haven't already, install an IDE suitable for Java development.
- Recommended IDEs: [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/), [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/), [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html).

## Step 3: Install Git
- Git will be used for version control and collaboration.
- Download and install Git from [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Step 4: Fork and Clone the Repository
- Fork the project repository provided by the instructor to your GitHub account.
- Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
  ```
- Navigate to the cloned directory:
  ```bash
  cd <repository-name>
  ```

## Step 5: Set Up the Project in Your IDE
- Open your IDE and import the cloned project.
- Ensure that the IDE correctly recognizes the project as a Java project and sets up the JDK.

## Step 6: Verify the Setup
- Run a simple test (such as printing a message) to verify that your setup is correct and that you can execute Java code.

## Step 7: Stay Updated
- Regularly pull changes from the main repository to stay up to date with any updates or changes made by the instructor or teammates.

## Additional Tools (Optional)
- Consider installing additional tools or plugins that might help with development, such as Maven or Gradle for build automation, or a plugin for Git integration within your IDE.

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter any issues during the setup, first check online for potential solutions.
- If the issue persists, don't hesitate to reach out to your instructor or team members for assistance.

## Next Steps
Once your setup is complete, refer to the `README.md` for project instructions and start coding!
