# Java School Chat Application Project

## Overview
This project is part of the Java School curriculum, focusing on applying concepts learned in Multithreading, Design Patterns, and Basic Networking or HTTP. The objective is to create a simple, real-time chat application where users can send and receive messages.

## Objectives
- Understand and implement Multithreading in Java.
- Apply Design Patterns, specifically Singleton and Observer, in a practical project.
- Gain basic knowledge in Networking or HTTP to enable real-time communication.

## Project Requirements
1. **User Interface**: Create a simple user interface for sending and receiving messages.
2. **Multithreading**: Implement multithreading to handle multiple users simultaneously.
3. **Design Patterns**:
    - Use the Singleton pattern to manage the chat application instance.
    - Implement the Observer pattern to update chat for all users in real-time.
4. **Networking**: Use basic networking principles or HTTP to establish connections between users.
