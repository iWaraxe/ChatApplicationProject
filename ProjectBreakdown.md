### Project Breakdown into Tasks and Features

#### 1. Project Setup and Planning (Initial Phase)
- **Task 1**: Set up a shared GitHub repository and decide on a branching strategy.
- **Task 2**: Create a basic project structure in Java (e.g., using Maven or Gradle).
- **Task 3**: Draft an initial project plan outlining the major features and deadlines.

#### 2. User Interface Design
- **Task 4**: Design a simple user interface for the chat application.
    - Sub-task: Create a basic layout for sending and receiving messages.
    - Sub-task: Implement user input fields and display areas for chat messages.

#### 3. Core Functionality Development
- **Task 5**: Implement multithreading for handling multiple chat sessions.
- **Task 6**: Develop the network communication setup (choose between sockets, HTTP, etc.).
    - Sub-task: Establish server-client architecture.
    - Sub-task: Implement message sending and receiving capabilities.

#### 4. Design Patterns Implementation
- **Task 7**: Apply the Singleton pattern for managing the chat application instance.
- **Task 8**: Implement the Observer pattern to update chat in real-time for all users.
    - Sub-task: Define the Observer interface and concrete observer classes.
    - Sub-task: Implement the Subject interface and manage subscriptions.

#### 5. Testing and Debugging
- **Task 9**: Conduct unit testing for individual components (e.g., message sending, user connection).
- **Task 10**: Perform integration testing to ensure all parts of the application work together seamlessly.

#### 6. Code Quality and Documentation
- **Task 11**: Review and refactor code to adhere to Java best practices.
- **Task 12**: Document the code and write a comprehensive README file.

#### 7. Final Review and Submission
- **Task 13**: Conduct a final project review to ensure compliance with the rubric.
- **Task 14**: Prepare and submit the project along with all necessary documentation.

### Additional Notes for Team Collaboration
- **Regular Check-ins**: Schedule weekly meetings to assess progress, discuss challenges, and adjust task assignments if needed.
- **Peer Review**: Implement a system where each team member reviews the otherâ€™s code for one or two tasks to promote learning and ensure code quality.

By following this structured approach, the students can work collaboratively and systematically to achieve the objectives of the project while gaining valuable experience in different aspects of Java development. This breakdown also aligns with the rubric points, ensuring a comprehensive coverage of the required skills and knowledge.
